# 🔧 GitHub Actions - Simple Setup

This repository uses a **minimal GitHub Actions setup** with just **1 essential workflow**.

## 📋 Workflow Overview

### **Code Quality Check** (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs

**What it does**:

- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ ESLint code quality checks

**That's it!** No complex deployments, no security audits, no performance testing - just the essential code quality checks.

## 🚀 Workflow Triggers

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
```

## 📊 Benefits of Simple Setup

### **Ultra-Minimal**:

- ✅ 1 workflow file only
- ✅ 2 essential checks
- ✅ No complex configurations
- ✅ No secrets required
- ✅ Fast execution (~2-3 minutes)
- ✅ Easy to understand and maintain

## 🎯 What Gets Checked

1. **TypeScript Check** (`npm run type-check`)
   - Validates all TypeScript types
   - Catches type errors before merge

2. **ESLint Check** (`npm run lint`)
   - Code quality and style
   - Catches potential bugs
   - Enforces coding standards

## 🛠️ Customization

### **Adding More Checks**

If you want to add more checks later, just add steps to `ci.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Your New Check
  run: your-command-here
```

### **Changing Triggers**

Update the `on:` section:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, feature/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

## 📈 Performance

| Metric               | Value           |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| **Workflow Files**   | 1               |
| **Execution Time**   | ~2-3 minutes    |
| **Dependencies**     | Node.js 20 only |
| **Secrets Required** | None            |
| **Maintenance**      | Minimal         |
